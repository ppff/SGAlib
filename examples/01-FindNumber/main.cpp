/* In this example, we set up a genetic algorithm to find a number.
 * A chromosome will be defined as a series of numbers between 0 and 9, effectively representing a number.
 * The score of a chromosome will be inversely proportional to its distance with the desired number.
 */
 
/* During the execution, if you enter a number high enough, the algorithm might be long to find it.
 * This is because, in the end, we need the best individual to change a tiny bit only, which is rather hard because it can only happen:
 *  - with a mutation (low probability)
 *  - with a successful crossover with another individual which has the missing part (even lower probability)
 * 
 * This is what we could do to improve this:
 *  - choose a better scoring function (but which one?)
 *  - give the score depending on the novelty of the invidual (this is a very different concept called Novelty Search which might be interesting to try with this example).
