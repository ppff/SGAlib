This example shows how GAs can solve a classic NP-hard problem: 2D bin packing.
The objective is to pack a set of rectangles as tight as possible (ie. having the smallest bounding box).

A set of rectangles is generated when the program starts.
A gene is a pair of coordinates corresponding to the upper left corner of a rectangle. 
Since every chromosome has the same size than the number of rectangles, a chromosome describes the positions of all the rectangles.
The score function is made so that a chromosome is better if its bounding box is smaller. 
By running the GA, we eventually end up with a (probably non-optimal) solution to the problem.

Note that this program was made with Qt5. The easiest thing to do is to open the .pro file with QtCreator.
About the library, it is a good example of how the non-blocking mode can be used.

Also note that you have to stop the algorithm yourself when you think the packing is good enough.
